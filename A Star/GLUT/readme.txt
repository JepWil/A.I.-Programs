** INSTRUCTIONS AND GENERAL INFO BELOW **

Cells contain 3 entity types:
*Fallen Star
*Trading Post
*Spaceship
*Starchaser

and 3 standard aesthetic cell types:
*Spacegrass - TEAL-ish
*Crater - BLACK
*Dirt - BROWN

Cells also have either of 2 access types:
*Free - Looks like any of the standard cell types.
*Blocked - "Deep red" cells which may be of any standard cell type.

To assign a new location to an entity:
1. Press UP/DOWN arrow keys to make an entity type selection. The selection type will be printed to the console window.
2. Left click on the new location for the desired entity.

To change the accessibility of a cell:
1. Right click on the desired cell. Color will change accordingly.


Each simulation happens in the following steps:
** Starchaser -> Fallen Star -> Trading Post **

Each step may be interrupted if the Starchaser is too fatigued at which point he will search for the Spaceship and rest.
He will then resume his previous task until reaching the trading post.
Once a Fallen Star has been traded it will randomly respawn at a location unless the user has selected a new location for it.


Note: Entity locations can be changed at will, however if the Starchaser is currently traveling to another entity, 
the destination entity's location and starchaser should not be changed.


Thanks for playing!
